# The Javascript Quiz

## Description

This readme contains information on the Javascript Quiz website that I have created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The link to the deployed live site can be found in the "Links" section of this readme. All buttons and links in the deployed website are functioning properly. This Javascript Quiz website contains 5 questions that a user must answer within a specific time frame. The website contains a welcome page, quiz questions, high score submissions, and a quiz complete page. The score and name of the user is set using local storage.

Ten seconds are deducted for each question wrong. At the end of the quiz, the user can submit their score and initials to be recorded in the "High Scores" section.
